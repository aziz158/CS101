List.c consist of List class that have functionalities of 
Doubly Linked List with an addition of cursor Node, that helps
to navigate and manipulate data inside of the List. This time it can take only integers as a data inside the Node.

List.h header of List.c

Graph.c consist of Graph ADT that represents adjacency representation of a Graph Data Structure. It also includes manipulation functions to Graph such as addEdge, addArc MakeNull
BFS and getPath.

Graph.h is a header file of Graph.c

GraphClient is My GraphTest file that test all functions of Graph.c

FindPath is an Empty file.

Makefile is a file that builds this program.

Note To Grader: I have been working on my Graph.c for the entire two weeks. I kept getting segmentation faults for the reasons i couldn't understand
It finally worked and passed all of the tests and hope to get at least partial credit for all of the work I've done.
I didn't have enough time for my FindPath.c since I'm submitting it a night before that's why I'm submitting my FindPath.c Empty.

Also my GraphClient.c is my test file if I use different name make file doesn't work since it is provided.
