List.c consist of List class that have functionalities of 
Doubly Linked List with an addition of cursor Node, that helps
to navigate and manipulate data inside of the List. This time it can take only integers as a data inside the Node.

Graph.c consist of Graph ADT that represents adjacency representation of a Graph Data Structure. It also includes manipulation functions to Graph such as addEdge, addArc MakeNull
DFS and transpose.

Graph.h is a header file of Graph.c

GraphClient.c is My GraphTest file that test all functions of Graph.c

FindComponents.c consist of algorithm that finds strong connected component in the graph and prints it out to the output file.

Makefile is a file that builds this program.

Note To Grader:
My GraphClient.c is my test file if I use different name make file doesn't work since it is provided.
