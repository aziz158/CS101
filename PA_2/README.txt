Description: 
This Submission primarily focuses on Lex.c List.c and List.h.

List.h is a header file that contains all of the function for List.c

List.c consist of List class that have functionalities of 
Doubly Linked List with an addition of cursor Node, that helps
to navigate and manipulate data inside of the List.

Lex.c is a program that takes two arguments: Input and Output files.
Using List.c and List.h functionalities it stores every single line of Input file
into the poitnter char String array, and then using List.c, sorts indexes of string
in alphabetical order into a List. After that it creates an Output file and 
writes down all values of String array corresponding to the indexes that are
in the List, which turns the output into the alphabetical order of input.

ListClient.c is a test file for the List.c.

Makefile is a file that builds this program.
